# Pickup-stick Sort

This sorting algorithm is one I created myself (in the name of amusement rather than efficiency).

The name *pickup-stick sort* is due to how elements are chosen at random to be sorted.

## Algorithm

The algorithm involves choosing any two random elements in the set and sorting them relatively. After every single such comparison, the entire set of elements is checked to determine whether more 'sorting' is necessary.
