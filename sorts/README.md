# sorts
C implementations of various sorts on arrays of integers.
Some sorts have been rewritten in other languages for alternate purposes; you can find these in the other-languages directory. Not all sorts are guaranteed to be ported.

The current list of sorts is as follows:

1. Bogosort
2. Bubble sort
3. Cocktail sort
4. Insertion sort
5. Quick sort
6. Merge sort
7. Selection sort
8. Shell sort

###Todo:
1. Improve testing implementation, and add testing for the rewritten sorts.
1. Implement comb sort.
1. Implement heapsort.
1. Implement radix sort.
