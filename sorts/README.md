# sorts
C implementations of various sorts on arrays of integers.
Some sorts have been rewritten in other languages for alternate purposes; you can find these in the other-languages directory. Not all sorts are guaranteed to be ported.

The current list of sorts is as follows:

1. Bogosort
1. Bubble sort
1. Cocktail sort
1. Insertion sort
1. Merge sort
1. Pickup-stick sort
1. Quick sort
1. Selection sort
1. Shell sort
1. [Stalin sort](https://mastodon.social/@mathew/100958177234287431)

###Todo:
1. Improve testing implementation, and add testing for the rewritten sorts.
1. Implement comb sort.
1. Implement heapsort.
1. Implement radix sort.
